# Atlas-test
Project created for technical test of a company that I was hired

- Pixel perfect
- Faithful to Figma
- Responsive
- No external libraries (only VueJS in the listing)
- Use the company's API of choice
- Use vuex with persist
- Use nomeclature BEM
- Standardized commits and code according to the company's style guide.

It was my first experience working with a monolithic project, I have always worked with SPA.
